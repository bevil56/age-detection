# Age and Gender Prediction Using MLP, VGG16, and Custom CNN

This repository contains implementations of three different models for predicting age and gender from facial images: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), VGG16, and Custom Convolutional Neural Network (Custom CNN). The models are trained and evaluated on the UTKFace dataset.
